The practical exercises are good so the user knows exactly how to use the programme
The idea of having this workshop was very important. We need more training
Gradual and systematic method of presentation
Course structures lessons especially OpenRefine
The workshop is very interesting. I have learnt a lot so far. I think this will be very useful for my research
Nice eye opening presentation. Not too fast and not too slow
I have learnt how to clean up data using openrefine
I have learnt a lot of things on Excel which I did not know before
Great lesson I am now ready to start doing data analysis on my research project!
It's a learning curve and it's exciting. I want to know more.
It's improving our data management skills a lot
The lessons provided knowledge and the instructor was audible. I realised that in as much as I have used Excel for a while, there was a lot I didn't.
OpenRefine is a good tool that will help me do better cleaning of my data
